	  <h2 id="components">Components used in video games</h2>
	
	<p>Typically, video games use a joystick as an input device, a monitor 
and speaker as output. With the progress of the technology, much more 
advanced devices have been released to be used for input and output 
units. For example, automobile steering systems, aircraft consoles, 
vibrating joysticks and pedals, etc.</p>

	<h2 id="history">History</h2>
	
	<p>The world's first video game is known as the game played using a 
cathode ray tube amusement device.</p>
	<p>Console games have left their place to computer games in the 90s, 
but with Sony's PlayStation, the consoles have again started to compete 
with computers. After PlayStation's release, the competition between 
"Xbox, Wii, Nintendo Dual Screen, PlayStation" consoles and computers 
have increased.</p>

	<h2 id="types">Types of video games</h2>
	
	<p>The variety of video games is increasing over time. The absolute 
number of game genres is not known in any real sense, because game 
designers are trying to create their own genres for capturing an 
original title.</p>
	<p>Some common game types are:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>First-Person Shooter (FPS)</li>
		<li>Third-Person Shooter (TPS)</li>
		<li>Turn-Based Strategy (TPS)</li>
		<li>Role-Playing Game (RPG)</li>
		<li>Real-Time Strategy (RTS)</li>
		<li>Other Types
		  <ul class="circle">
			<li class="li">Sports Game</li>
			<li class="li">Action Game</li>
			<li class="li">Racing Game</li>
		  </ul>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	
	<h2 id="tools">Game designing tools (game engines)</h2>
	
	<table class="pic_editor">
	  <tr>
		<td> <img src="img/Virtual-camera-system.png" title="Editor" alt="An example of an editor" width="322" height="322"> </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr> 
		<td> <em>Developers use various tools to create video games. Here an editor is fine-tuning the virtual camera system.</em> </td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>These tools are called game engines and they are designed to relieve 
game designers while working with million lines of codes. The designer 
enters some simple commands, meanwhile on the background, the game 
engine translates these simple commands into complicated codes and 
finally, the programming language which have used to make the game 
engine itself translates all these commands into bit format (0-1 system) 
that only a computer can understand.</p>
	
	<p>Some popular game engines today are:</p>
	  <ol>
		<li>Unreal Engine</li>
		<li>Unity 3D</li>
		<li>CryEngine 3</li>
		<li>Game Maker</li>
		<li>FPS Creator</li>
		<li>Game Editor</li>
		<li>RPG Maker</li>
		<li>Blender (Also a 3D modeling and 3D animation tool)</li>
		<li>OGRE</li>
	  </ol>
	
	<h2 id="cheats">Video game cheats</h2>
	
	<p>Video game cheats are "changes" that you can make to your player or 
other characters by taking advantage of various bugs in games. For 
example, making a character immortal, equipping it with various weapons, 
killing a man in one shot, etc. Cheats made to use in online games are 
considered as a criminal offense and they are usually sold to other 
online players by creators of cheats.</p>
	<p>Some single games have cheats added by the game maker. These cheats 
are usually activated by writing a predefined keyword phrase.</p>
