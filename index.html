							Video Games
	
	A video game is type of a game that played using a visual user 
interface (television, monitor, etc.) with a video source that sends an 
image signal, such as a computer or game console.

	Components used in video games
	
	Typically, video games use a joystick as an input device, a monitor 
and speaker as output. With the progress of the technology, much more 
advanced devices have been released to be used for input and output 
units. For example, automobile steering systems, aircraft consoles, 
vibrating joysticks and pedals, etc.

	History
	
	The world's first video game is known as the game played using a 
cathode ray tube amusement device.
	Console games have left their place to computer games in the 90s, 
but with Sony's PlayStation, the consoles have again started to compete 
with computers. After PlayStation's release, the competition between 
"Xbox, Wii, Nintendo Dual Screen, PlayStation" consoles and computers 
have increased.

	Types of video games
	
	The variety of video games is increasing over time. The absolute 
number of game genres is not known in any real sense, because game 
designers are trying to create their own genres for capturing an 
original title. Some common game types are:
	
	ꞏFirst-Person Shooter (FPS)
	ꞏThird-Person Shooter (TPS)
	ꞏTurn-Based Strategy (TPS)
	ꞏRole-Playing Game (RPG)
	ꞏReal-Time Strategy (RTS)
	ꞏSports Game
	ꞏAction Game
	ꞏRacing Game
	
	Game designing tools (game engines)
	
	These tools are called game engines and they are designed to relieve 
game designers while working with million lines of codes. The designer 
enters some simple commands, meanwhile on the background, the game 
engine translates these simple commands into complicated codes and 
finally, the programming language which have used to make the game 
engine itself translates all these commands into bit format (0-1 system) 
that only a computer can understand. 
	Some popular game engines today are:
	
	ꞏUnreal Engine
	ꞏUnity 3D
	ꞏCryEngine 3
	ꞏGame Maker
	ꞏFPS Creator
	ꞏGame Editor
	ꞏRPG Maker
	ꞏBlender (Also a 3D modeling and 3D animation tool)
	ꞏOGRE
	
	Video game cheats
	
	Video game cheats are "changes" that you can make to your player or 
other characters by taking advantage of various bugs in games. For 
example, making a character immortal, equipping it with various weapons, 
killing a man in one shot, etc. Cheats made to use in online games are 
considered as a criminal offense and they are usually sold to other 
online players by creators of cheats.
	Some single games have cheats added by the game maker. These cheats 
are usually activated by writing a predefined keyword phrase.
